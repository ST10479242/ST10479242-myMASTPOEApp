## 📱 Overview

The **Chef’s Menu Creator** helps chefs quickly add and organize dishes into different courses such as **Starters**, **Mains**, and **Desserts**.  
All data is stored in memory during the app session — no hardcoded values and no permanent storage needed.

This app was created for a coursework task to demonstrate basic React Native component usage, state management, and user interaction.

## 🧑‍🍳 Usage Instructions

### 1. Clone or Create the Project
If starting fresh, create a new Expo app:
npx create-expo-app chef-menu-app -t expo-template-blank-typescript

npm install @react-native-picker/picker

## 🎨 Design Notes

Color palette inspired by rustic restaurant tones (warm browns and creams).

Clean spacing and rounded cards for a friendly, aesthetic appearance.

Layout avoids common FlatList and ScrollView nesting issues for smooth scrolling and dropdowns.
